Creative and unusual things that can be done with the Windows API.

Even Microsoft Word is not safe from being shrunk:

## Writing Directly To The Desktop

This utility can write anything to any location on top of the Desktop. To remove the text just drag a window over top of it.

## Hue Shifter

Any window can be selected to have its pixels' hues shifted. In the following exhibit I shift the hues of Microsoft Paint:

## Notes

The External folder contains two essential .dll files that must be referenced for the code to work. These two files are WindowsAPI.dll and and ImageProcessing.dll and the code for these can be seen in my Task-Automation and Image-Processing-Library repositories respectively.
